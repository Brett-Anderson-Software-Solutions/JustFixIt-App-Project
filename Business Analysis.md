# 1. Introduction
## 1. Business purpose
  * JustFixIt is a residential remodeling company local to Southwest Florida. The business consistently has multiple jobs at different stages happening simultaneously. Due to this, the business has much of its resources spread among various job sites, trailers, a central shop, etc. at any given time. Typically, when supplies are requested on a job site, the site supervisor makes a trip to the nearest hardware store to pick up these supplies. Most of the new supplies being purchased on a daily basis are readily available within the company's inventory, yet there is currently no available method for employees to check the company's inventory from a single point of access. This causes much of the available inventory to get "buried" or become lost or forgotten, therefore causing these in-house supplies to not be completely consumed. This reduces efficiency and increase costs. The business needs a central, single point of access inventory management system to reduce operating costs, increase efficiency of supply usage, and increase overall operational productivity.
## 2. Business scope
  * The domain of operation is residential remodeling, or more generally, construction. The acquisition, storage, and deployment of resources and supplies to various job sites is a large part of ensuring operational efficiency of the business. Employees on the various job sites can get jobs done faster if resources are readily available and their location is known. The proposed system will provide a single point of access to the company's inventory at any given time, allowing employees to track and record inventory as it moves. This will allow supervisors to make informed decisions on how to source supplies as they are needed, making the process of sourcing supplies more efficient and cost effective.
## 3. Overview
  * The owner of the business as well as the site supervisors participate directly in the process of sourcing supplies for the various job sites on a daily basis. There is a constant issue of operations halting due to lack of resources to complete jobs. Therefore, there is a repeated cycle of supervisors constantly going to hardware stores to puchase new supplies rather than sourcing them from the business' inventory.
## 4. Definitions 
  * Not applicable.
## 5. Major stakeholders 
  * The owner would like the system to reduce costs and increase operational efficiency of the business.
  * The site supervisors would like the system to reduce trips to the hardware store and increase job site productivity.
  * The employees would like the system to be simple and efficient to use.

## 1. Business environment
  * The nature of the business is influenced by state and local laws and building codes that regulate the construction industry.
  * https://www.floridabuilding.org/bc/bc_default.aspx
## 2. Mission, goals, and objectives
  * The proposed system will reduce supply costs and increase operational efficiency on job sites. The system will also improve productivity of the site supervisors as they will spend less time going to hardware stores to purchase supplies.
## 3. Business model
  * Better planning from the start of each job and throughout the duration of the project until completion, performed by the supervisors using the inventory management system. This will ensure in-house supplies are used first and used to completion before purchasing new supplies. Employees will use the system to identify what supplies they have readily available around them and to log locations and amounts used of materials when storing them.
## 4. Information environment
  * A single point of access database will store all company inventory data.

# 5. Preliminary operational concept of proposed system
## 5.1 Preliminary operational concept
### a) operational policies and constraints;
  * In accordance with business operational policies, the system will ensure same day communication with clients. The business operates strictly within Southwest Florida, particularly Collier and Lee counties. The platform will inform potential clients on these geographical limits before allowing them to request an estimate or begin communications with the business.
### b) description of the proposed system;
  * The system will consist of a single-point-of-access platform that showcases products and services offered. The platform will also enable open communication between the business and clients and will be the primary communication method for clients. The system will facilitate opening new projects as clients will be able to request estimates through the platform.
### c) modes of system operation;
  * The system will have the following modes of operation:
    * Discovery - Users will explore products and services offered on the platform.
    * Communication - Users will be able to communicate directly with the business through the platform.
    * Scheduling/Requests - Users can request estimates from the business and request a specific date and time preferred.
### d) user classes and other involved personnel; and
  * The primary user class will be clients of the business as they will use the platform for discovery, communication, and requests. The owner and supervisors of the business will also use the platform for communication with clients and evaluating estimate requests for scheduling purposes.
### e) support environment.
  * The development firm (myself) will provide support throughout employee training for use of the system. The firm will also provide long-term support and maintenance for the system throughout the life of the system.
## 5.2 Preliminary operational scenarios
  1. Client Discovery
    * Potential clients will browse the products and service offered on the platform to see if the company is a good fit for their home improvement project. If the potential client decides to move forward with the company for their project, they can initiate an estimate request through the platform, requesting the business to come to their home and provide a bid for the desired home improvement project. The business owner can then confirm scheduling or respond to their request through the platform.
  2. Communication between Business Owner and Client
    * A client wants to add painting of the full interior of their home to an ongoing project. The client uses the platform to send a message to the business owner requesting an estimate for this addition to the project. The business owner responds the same day informing the client of a price and updated timeline for the addition to the project. The client responds confirming they would like to move forward with this addition to the project. The business owner sends a confirmation message and updated invoice to the client the same day and adds the addition to the project outline.
  3. Important Project Updates
    * The business underestimated how long a certain portion of the project would take to complete, and now they are running behind schedule. The business owner needs to inform the client of this change to the timeline and potential additional costs. The business owner immediately sends a message to the client via the platform to inform them of this update. The client responds immediately indicating that they would like to terminate the project due to increased costs and timeline. The business owner can now negotiate the price to try to retain the project or confirm the termination and pull any employeees from the project site before any unpaid work is performed.
# 6. Other preliminary life-cycle concepts
## 6.1 Preliminary acquisition concept
  * Stakeholders involved in the process of solution development will include the business owner, development firm (me), current clients of the business, supervisors, and employees. The solution and requirements will be sourced from collaboration through meetings and dicussions as well as elicitation through surveys and interviews. Once formed, the solution will be developed by the developing firm (me) while all stakeholders will participate in design decisions throughout the development process. Verification will be implemented by testing on the system (performed by the development firm) as well as frequent deliveries of working software that can be validated by all of the stakeholders.
## 6.2 Preliminary deployment concept
  * The developing firm will deliver working software frequently (every 2 weeks) that is discussed with and validated by the stakeholders. Feeedback will be provided and changes will be implemented in the next delivery, if possible. As these deliveries are validated, they will be moved into the production environment iteratively.
## 6.3 Preliminary support concept
  * The developmeent firm (myself) will provide direct training to the business owner and employees as well as some current clients. There will be an overview video available as well providing the best ways to use the system effectively. Maintenance support will be performed by the development firm for the life of the system. Engineering and operating support will also be managed by the development firm for the life of the system. No additional support personnel will be required. The business will be able to reach out to the development firm directly for support as needed.
## 6.4 Preliminary retirement concept
  * The system will be removed from the production environment when the development firm can no longer support the system or the business requires new methods of attracting business or communicating with customers. The development firm will handle retiring the system by removing access to it from the business slowly as temporary solutions are put in place to replace it.
# 7. Project Constraints
  * The system needs to be deployed and operational by 2024, therefore simplicity will be key in evaluating solutions as there may not be time to create extensive features. Costs will not play a factor in this project as it is being completed at no cost to the business. The business will need to consider server and other hosting costs for the life of the system (if it is deployed on the web).
