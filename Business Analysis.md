# 1. Introduction
## 1. Business purpose
  * JustFixIt is a residential remodeling company local to Southwest Florida. The business consistently has multiple jobs at different stages happening simultaneously. Due to this, the business has much of its resources spread among various job sites, trailers, a central shop, etc. at any given time. Typically, when supplies are requested on a job site, the site supervisor makes a trip to the nearest hardware store to pick up these supplies. Most of the new supplies being purchased on a daily basis are readily available within the company's inventory, yet there is currently no available method for employees to check the company's inventory from a single point of access. This causes much of the available inventory to get "buried" or become lost or forgotten, therefore causing these in-house supplies to not be completely consumed. This reduces efficiency and increase costs. The business needs a central, single point of access inventory management system to reduce operating costs, increase efficiency of supply usage, and increase overall operational productivity.
## 2. Business scope
  * The domain of operation is residential remodeling, or more generally, construction. The acquisition, storage, and deployment of resources and supplies to various job sites is a large part of ensuring operational efficiency of the business. Employees on the various job sites can get jobs done faster if resources are readily available and their location is known. The proposed system will provide a single point of access to the company's inventory at any given time, allowing employees to track and record inventory as it moves. This will allow supervisors to make informed decisions on how to source supplies as they are needed, making the process of sourcing supplies more efficient and cost effective.
## 3. Overview
  * The owner of the business as well as the site supervisors participate directly in the process of sourcing supplies for the various job sites on a daily basis. There is a constant issue of operations halting due to lack of resources to complete jobs. Therefore, there is a repeated cycle of supervisors constantly going to hardware stores to puchase new supplies rather than sourcing them from the business' inventory.
## 4. Definitions 
  * Not applicable.
## 5. Major stakeholders 
  * The owner would like the system to reduce costs and increase operational efficiency of the business.
  * The site supervisors would like the system to reduce trips to the hardware store and increase job site productivity.
  * The employees would like the system to be simple and efficient to use.

## 1. Business environment
  * The nature of the business is influenced by state and local laws and building codes that regulate the construction industry.

## 2. Mission, goals, and objectives
  * The proposed system will reduce supply costs and increase operational efficiency on job sites. The system will also improve productivity of the site supervisors as they will spend less time going to hardware stores to purchase supplies.
## 3. Business model
  * Better planning from the start of each job and throughout the duration of the project until completion, performed by the supervisors using the inventory management system. This will ensure in-house supplies are used first and used to completion before purchasing new supplies. Employees will use the system to identify what supplies they have readily available around them and to log locations and amounts used of materials when storing them.
## 4. Information environment
  * A single point of access database will store all company inventory data.

# 5. Preliminary operational concept of proposed system
## 5.1 Preliminary operational concept
### a) operational policies and constraints;
  * In accordance with business operational policies, the system will ensure same day communication with clients. The business operates strictly within Southwest Florida, particularly Collier and Lee counties. The platform will inform potential clients on these geographical limits before allowing them to request an estimate or begin communications with the business.
### b) description of the proposed system;
  * The system will consist of a single-point-of-access platform that showcases products and services offered. The platform will also enable open communication between the business and clients and will be the primary communication method for clients. The system will facilitate opening new projects as clients will be able to request estimates through the platform.
### c) modes of system operation;
  * The system will have the following modes of operation:
    * Discovery - Users will explore products and services offered on the platform.
    * Communication - Users will be able to communicate directly with the business through the platform.
    * Scheduling/Requests - Users can request estimates from the business and request a specific date and time preferred.
### d) user classes and other involved personnel; and
  * The primary user class will be clients of the business as they will use the platform for discovery, communication, and requests. The owner and supervisors of the business will also use the platform for communication with clients and evaluating estimate requests for scheduling purposes.
### e) support environment.
  * The development firm (myself) will provide support throughout employee training for use of the system. The firm will also provide long-term support and maintenance for the system throughout the life of the system.
